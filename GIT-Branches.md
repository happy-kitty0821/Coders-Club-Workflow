# Branching Strategy for Coders Club Project

## Overview

This document outlines the branching strategy for our web application project. The strategy ensures a streamlined workflow for development, bug fixing, feature experimentation, and documentation updates.

## Branch Types

### `main`
- **Purpose**: This branch represents the production-ready code and is used for deployments.
- **Access Control**: Restricted. Only main developers can push changes and merge pull requests.
- **Usage**: Merges into `main` are made from `developing` after thorough testing and review.

### `developing`
- **Purpose**: The main development branch where all development work occurs.
- **Usage**: All developers work on feature branches derived from `developing`. Once features and bug fixes are tested, they are merged back into `developing`.
- **Integration**: Regularly merged into `main` for releases.

### `bugfixes`
- **Purpose**: Dedicated to addressing and merging bug fixes.
- **Usage**: Branches are created from `developing` to handle specific bugs. After fixing and testing, these branches are merged back into both `developing` and `main` (if the bug is critical).

### `experimental/features`
- **Purpose**: Used for developing new features or experimenting with changes.
- **Usage**: Allows for experimental work without affecting the main development flow. Once experiments are validated, they are merged into `developing`.
- **Integration**: Periodically sync with `developing` to reduce conflicts.

### `documentation`
- **Purpose**: For maintaining and updating project documentation.
- **Usage**: Includes changes to README files, API documentation, and other related documents. Updates should be merged into both `developing` and `main` to ensure consistency.

### Optional Branches

#### `release`
- **Purpose**: For preparing and finalizing releases.
- **Usage**: Created from `developing` when preparing for a new release. Final tests and adjustments are made here before merging into `main` and `developing`.
- **Integration**: Merged into `main` for deployment and into `developing` to incorporate any release-related changes.

#### `hotfix`
- **Purpose**: For urgent fixes in the production environment.
- **Usage**: Branches off from `main` to address critical issues. After applying the fix, merge the hotfix branch back into both `main` and `developing`.
- **Integration**: Ensures immediate fixes are applied to both production and development codebases.

## Branch Structure

Below is the visual representation of the branching strategy and how different branches relate to each other:

```
main
|
|-- developing
|   |-- feature/user-authentication
|   |-- bugfix/login-issue
|   |-- release/v1.0.0
|
|-- hotfix/critical-issue
|
|-- experimental/features
|
|-- documentation
```

- **`main`**: The production branch where stable releases are deployed.
- **`developing`**: The main branch for ongoing development and integration of features and fixes.
- **`bugfixes`**: A branch dedicated to addressing and integrating bug fixes.
- **`experimental/features`**: For experimental features and new developments not yet merged into `developing`.
- **`documentation`**: For managing and updating project documentation.
- **`release`**: Optional branch for finalizing releases before merging into `main`.
- **`hotfix`**: Optional branch for urgent production fixes.

## Workflow

1. **Development**:
   - Start new work on feature branches created from `developing`.
   - After completion, push changes and open a pull request to merge into `developing`.
   - Review and merge the pull request following successful testing.

2. **Release Preparation**:
   - Create a `release` branch from `developing` when a release is imminent.
   - Conduct final testing and fixes in the `release` branch.
   - Merge `release` into `main` and `developing`.

3. **Bug Fixes**:
   - For critical bugs, create a `hotfix` branch from `main`.
   - For non-critical bugs, use `bugfixes` branches from `developing`.
   - Merge fixes back into `main` and `developing` as appropriate.

4. **Experimental Features**:
   - Work on new features or experiments in `experimental/features`.
   - Merge successful experiments into `developing`.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update the `documentation` branch as needed.
   - Merge documentation changes into `developing` and `main`.

## Branch Management

- **Regular Merges**: Regularly merge `developing` into `experimental/features` and `bugfixes` to stay up-to-date and minimize conflicts.
- **Automate CI/CD**: Implement Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) to automate testing and deployment processes.
- **Branch Protection**: Set up branch protection rules to enforce code reviews and passing tests for `main` and `developing`.
- **Cleanup**: Periodically remove old branches that are no longer needed to keep the repository organized.
