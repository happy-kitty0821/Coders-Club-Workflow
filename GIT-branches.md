### Branch Overview

1. **`main`**:
   - **Purpose**: This is the production-ready branch. It is used for deployment and should always reflect the stable state of your application.
   - **Access Control**: Restricted to main developers who can push changes and merge pull requests. This helps ensure that only reviewed and tested changes are deployed.
   - **Deployment**: Automated or manual deployments should be triggered from this branch.

2. **`developing`**:
   - **Purpose**: This is the primary branch where all development work occurs. Developers branch off from here to work on features or bug fixes.
   - **Collaboration**: All developers work on this branch, which should be kept up-to-date with `main` through regular merges or rebases.
   - **Integration**: It serves as an integration branch where all features, bug fixes, and improvements are combined before they are considered stable.

3. **`bugfixes`**:
   - **Purpose**: Dedicated branch for addressing and merging bug fixes. This branch can be used for fixes that need to be validated before being merged into `developing`.
   - **Integration**: Bug fixes should eventually be merged into both `developing` (for ongoing development) and `main` (for production deployment).

4. **`experimental/features`**:
   - **Purpose**: Used for developing new features or experimental changes. This branch allows developers to work on and test new ideas without affecting the main development flow.
   - **Integration**: Once features are stable and tested, they can be merged into `developing`. It’s a good practice to periodically sync this branch with `developing` to minimize conflicts.

5. **`documentation`**:
   - **Purpose**: Focuses solely on documentation updates, such as README files, API documentation, and other project-related docs.
   - **Integration**: Changes in this branch should be merged into `developing` and `main` if they are relevant to the production code.

### Example Workflow

#### Development
1. **Start a New Feature or Bug Fix**:
   - Branch off from `developing` for a new feature or bug fix. For example:
     - `feature/user-authentication`
     - `bugfix/login-issue`
   - Work on the branch and commit changes.

2. **Testing and Review**:
   - Push changes to your remote feature/bugfix branch.
   - Open a pull request (PR) to merge into `developing`.
   - After code review and testing, merge the PR into `developing`.

3. **Feature Stabilization**:
   - Once a feature or bug fix is stable and tested, merge it into `developing`.
   - Regularly merge `developing` into `experimental/features` if necessary to keep it up-to-date.

4. **Release Preparation**:
   - When the code in `developing` is ready for release, create a pull request to merge it into `main`.
   - Ensure thorough testing and validation before merging to `main`.

5. **Bug Fixes**:
   - If a critical bug is found, create a branch from `main` (if it’s production critical) or from `developing`.
   - Once fixed and tested, merge back into both `main` and `developing`.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Make updates to the `documentation` branch as needed.
   - Merge documentation changes into both `developing` and `main` to keep documentation consistent with the code.

### Example Branch Structure

```
main
|
|-- developing
|   |-- feature/user-authentication
|   |-- bugfix/login-issue
|
|-- bugfixes
|
|-- experimental/features
|
|-- documentation
```

### Summary

- **`main`**: For production-ready code and deployment.
- **`developing`**: For ongoing development work by all developers.
- **`bugfixes`**: For addressing and integrating bug fixes.
- **`experimental/features`**: For new features and experimental changes.
- **`documentation`**: For maintaining and updating project documentation.

This structure will help you manage your development workflow efficiently, ensuring a clear path from development to production while keeping experimental work and documentation updates organized.
